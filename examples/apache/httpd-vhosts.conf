# Virtual Hosts
#
# Required modules: mod_log_config

# If you want to maintain multiple domains/hostnames on your
# machine you can setup VirtualHost containers for them. Most configurations
# use only name-based virtual hosts so the server doesn't need to worry about
# IP addresses. This is indicated by the asterisks in the directives below.
#
# Please see the documentation at 
# <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/vhosts/>
# for further details before you try to setup virtual hosts.
#
# You may use the command line option '-S' to verify your virtual host
# configuration.

#
# VirtualHost example:
# Almost any Apache directive may go into a VirtualHost container.
# The first VirtualHost section is used for all requests that do not
# match a ServerName or ServerAlias in any <VirtualHost> block.
#
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
    DocumentRoot "/usr/local/apache2/htdocs"
    ServerName localhost
    # ServerAlias www.localhost
    ErrorLog "logs/localhost-error_log"
    CustomLog "logs/localhost-access_log" common

    # Pass the PHP scripts to PHP-FPM via the Apache `mod_proxy_fcgi` Module
    # Change php-fpm endpoint. E.g: php-fpm:9090 (service_name:port)
    # https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_proxy_fcgi.html
    <FilesMatch \.(php|phar)$>
        SetHandler "proxy:fcgi://php-fpm:9000"
    </FilesMatch>

    #
    # Possible values for the Options directive are "None", "All",
    # or any combination of:
    #   Indexes Includes FollowSymLinks SymLinksifOwnerMatch ExecCGI MultiViews
    #
    # Note that "MultiViews" must be named *explicitly* --- "Options All"
    # doesn't give it to you.
    #
    # The Options directive is both complicated and important.  Please see
    # http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/core.html#options
    # for more information.
    #
    Options -Indexes

    <Directory "/usr/local/apache2/htdocs">
        DirectoryIndex index.htm index.html index.shtml index.php index.phtml

        #
        # AllowOverride controls what directives may be placed in .htaccess files.
        # It can be "All", "None", or any combination of the keywords:
        #   AllowOverride FileInfo AuthConfig Limit
        #
        AllowOverride All

        #
        # Controls who can get stuff from this server.
        #
        Require all granted
